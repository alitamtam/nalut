# How to Copy PostgreSQL Database with Prisma ORM for Production

To make a copy of your local PostgreSQL database with the same seeding data (such as users, articles, etc.) for production when using Prisma ORM, follow these steps:

## 1. Create a Dump of Your Local Database

First, create a dump of your local PostgreSQL database. This will include all the data and schema from your development environment.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pg_dump -U <username> -h localhost -d <database_name> -F c -f backup.sql
```

Replace:

- `<username>` with your PostgreSQL username.
- `<database_name>` with the name of your local database.
- `backup.sql` with the name of the backup file you want to create.

The `-F c` flag specifies a custom format suitable for restoring later.

## 2. Transfer the Dump to Production

Once you've created the dump file, transfer it to your production environment using secure file transfer (SCP), FTP, or other methods, depending on your server setup.

For SCP (example with SSH):

```bash
scp backup.sql <your_user>@<your_server>:<path_to_destination>
```

## 3. Restore the Dump to the Production Database

On your production environment, use `pg_restore` to restore the dumped data into the production PostgreSQL database.

```bash
pg_restore -U <username> -h localhost -d <production_database_name> -c -F c < backup.sql
```

Replace:

- `<username>` with your PostgreSQL username for the production database.
- `<production_database_name>` with the name of your production database.
- `backup.sql` with the name of the backup file you transferred.

The `-c` flag will clean the database before restoring it (i.e., it will drop existing tables before restoring the dump).

## 4. Run Prisma Migrations

Even though you've restored the data, ensure your production environment is up-to-date with your Prisma schema and migrations.

On your production server, run:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

This ensures any Prisma migrations that havenâ€™t been applied yet are deployed to the production database.

## 5. Seeding in Production (Optional)

If you still need to run the Prisma seed file on the production server, ensure the environment variable `DATABASE_URL` in production is correctly set to the production database URL. Then run:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

This will seed any additional data specified in your Prisma `seed.js` or `seed.ts` file.

By following these steps, you'll have the same seeded data and schema from your local PostgreSQL environment copied to your production environment.
