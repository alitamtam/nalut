  "eduLibyaDescription": {
  "part1": "All of us in EduLibya are connected to the education sector as students, teachers, parents, workshop leaders, researchers, social-psychological practitioners, and so on.",
  "part2": "We are a network of educators interested in various dimensions of education across Libya.",
  "part3": "We are a community of people who care enough to try and make a change in our society by making our educational system more meaningful for students and teachers. The value we create is for the community, not for us as individuals.",
  "part4": "The network aims to remain flexible and responsive — it is constantly waiting for you and all of us to decide what it will become.",
  "part5": "Before you commit to this network and choose a suitable time for our first meeting (see below), let me share some important details:",
  "point1": "1. There is no financial reward for joining this network. Most of the work we will do will be voluntary (because we believe it is vital and part of what we already do), but there will be no pressure to dedicate more time and effort than you can.",
  "point2": "2. This is not an accredited network or organization with certification authority. Attending workshops, meetings, and online discussions will not grant you a certificate. We attend these meetings because we want to learn and improve our thinking and practice in the field of education.",
  "part6": "At the heart of EduLibya lies a commitment to dialogue and community-building around the role of education in Libya. We see education as part of a larger ecosystem of human practices in society — education (whether formal or informal) interacts with various threads that form the fabric of our Libyan culture.",
  "part7": "We are not seeking to offer solutions to problems; instead, we aim to create deeper connections between each other and between our ideas and practices, hoping to see ourselves more clearly and to suggest ways to face our future.",
  "part8": "EduLibya moves through time and space organically, with ever-changing members communicating around ever-changing needs. The intentionally ambiguous nature of this space is the co-construction of a community that can build a shared language for change and movement in any desired direction."
